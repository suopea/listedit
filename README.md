# listedit

A simple but useful tool for editing lists. An attempt do one a simple thing really well, with lots of effort put into all trying to make all interactions fast and easy to understand. 

No dependencies (besides python) for mac/linux, for windows you need to add the `curses` module to python. 

Just run `py listedit.py` to choose or create a file interactively, or give an existing file as an argument `py listedit.py list_to_edit`.
